	x86, g3-osx, ppc-linux, generic

Choose platform (or generic if your platform is not listed) and then

	make install

This will install the binaries sha1 and hashcash in /usr/local/bin,

To change the binary installation location change the INSTALL_PATH in
the Makefile.  To change the man page installation location change the
