                           Cypherpunks anti-License

Intent

   The  intent  of  the Cypherpunks anti-License (CPL) is to inform users
   that  they  are free to use and redistribute the indicated work or any
   derived  or modified work in any manner they choose. Works distributed
   under the CPL are in the Public Domain.

Licensing

   The CPL is not a license, it does not require the user to do or not do
   anything;  the  user does not agree to any terms, because there are no
   terms,  and  the  user  does  not  need  to  do  anything  to indicate
   acceptance or rejection of the CPL.

Non Litigation

   The CPL serves to pledge to the user that the distributors will behave
   in a manner consistent with the non-existance of Intellectual Property
   (IP)  laws  as  far as they are able. The distributors will not use or
   participate  as  far  as  they are able to government legal systems to
   attempt  to  enforce  requests  restricting the use, modifications, or
   redistribution  of the work for perpetuity. The distributor may prefer
   to  be anonymous to preclude attempts to coerce them into enforcing IP
   laws relating to this work against their will.

Requests

   The work may be distributed with some distributor requests in addition
   to the CPL. The distributor pledges similarly to not attempt to use IP
   laws to enforce these requests.

Redistribution

   Users choosing to redistribute this work may change anything about the
   work,  including distributing it under a different license, and adding
   or removing previous distributors requests.

Interpretation

   The  CPL is completely liberal. Here are some examples of implications
   of   this  which  are  not  true  for  many  licenses.  The  user  can
   redistribute the work or a derived or modified work
     * under a different license of their choosing
     * with or without source code as they choose
     * without acknowledging the distributors or authors
     * with false or innaccurate claims about authorship of the work
     * advertise without acknowledging the authors

   Requests  can be arbitrary, but are requests only. Example of requests
   that the distributor may choose to make:
     * that  improvements  to  the  work  be  drawn  to  the distributors
       attention
     * that  improvements to the work be released back to the distributor
       under the CPL
     * that  the distributors name not be used to advertise derived works
       without the distributors approval

   Note: the above requests are examples only; the requests that apply to
   this work are attached at the bottom of this license.

Legacy Considerations

   The distributor may choose to inform the user of his opinion of the IP
   status  of  the work, for example by identifying any IP law restricted
   aspects  such  as  the  copyright holders of parts or the whole of the
   work,  trademark  owners  of  trademarks used in the work, potentially
   applicable  patents  on algorithms or ideas contained in the work, but
   the  distributor  is  not obliged to do so and takes no responsibility
   for the accuracy of such information.

Background

   The  CPL  is  written from a mindset which derides the very concept of
   Intellectual  Property  restrictions as being incompatible with a free
   society.

   Cryptographically  assured  anonymity  and  anonymous  use of Internet
   resources  mean  that  denizens  of  cypherspace can ignore copyright,
   licenses  attempting  to  control  use  and distribution of works, and
   patents  on  ideas.  It is not possible to enforce IP laws by calls to
   government legal systems when the flaunter is strongly anonymous.

   The  enforcement  of  IP  law and anonymity are in direct conflict. To
   fully enforce IP laws, anonymity would have to be outlawed.  Cypherpunks
   believe this would be a bad thing, because control of information imparts
   power, and anonymity gives individuals control over disclosure of
   information about themselves and their actions.

Hashcash Author

- The author is Adam Back.  I may be contacted at:

	Adam Back <adam@hashcash.org>
  or    Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

- two files getopt.c and getopt.h are GPL source.  They are not used on unix
  systems where the system getopt library is used.  However on windows to
  build the command line tool they are used.  These files are not however
  used by the hashcash library.  Conclusion: if you can't work with GPL, and
  you want the command line tool on systems which don't have a getopt system
  call, you will either have to reimplement that, or find a non GPL source.

  (If you find a more liberally licensed getopt that is compatible let me
  know and I will replace the current GPL one with it).

- The rest of the files I wrote and are covered solely by this license. 
  There were small changes contributed back but as far as I recall these
  were released back to me.
  
Hashcash CPL License Requests

- If you have to make changes to make this library work for your system or
  application it would be useful if you could tell me what you had to do,
  and optionally send me the source changes so I can include them or update
  the library.  The aim is to make a practically useful library.

- It would be useful if you could inform me if you use or distribute
  hashcash.  The intent here is to give me feedback and insight into the
  areas of application which people find useful in practice.

- If you are unclear on how to use hashcash there is a FAQ here:
  http://www.hashcash.org/faq.html.  If that doesn't answer your question or
  doesn't apply to your usage, feel free to discuss in email.

- It may help the deployment of hashcash as an anti-spam system if different
  systems based on hashcash were interoperable as far as that makes sense
  for your system.  To this end the FAQ http://www.hashcash.org/faq.html and
  Internet-Draft http://www.hashcash.org/draft-hashcash.txt document my
  thoughts in this area.  See also the hashcash home page
  http://www.hashcash.org and paper there as I update with links to deployed
  systems which it might be useful for you to interoperate with.
